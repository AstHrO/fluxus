Fluxus : (C) 2007 Dave Griffiths : dave at pawfal dot org : www.pawfal.org

"act of a flowing; a continuous moving on or passing by, as of a flowing stream; 
a continuous succession of changes"

Fluxus is a small realtime render engine for linux that generates animation from 
sound. Released under the GPL licence (see COPYING)

Installing
----------

Fluxus is a dependancy heavy application, and installing it can be a bit of a 
challenge - anyone who can help in this regard, please get in contact!

It requires:

ode (0.5)           http://opende.sourceforge.net/
plt scheme (369.10) http://www.plt-scheme.org/ (see below)
fftw (3.0.1)        http://www.fftw.org/
jack (1.0)          http://jackit.sourceforge.net/
libsndfile (1.0.12) http://www.mega-nerd.com/libsndfile/
liblo (0.5.0)       http://plugin.org.uk/liblo/
glew (1.3.4)        http://glew.sourceforge.net/

The version numbers in brackets are the version I've built it with, later versions
should also be ok, let me know (via the mailing list) if you run into problems.

And if that's not enough, you'll also need scons (http://www.scons.org/) to 
actually build fluxus.

PLT install instructions
------------------------

For the moment you need a version of PLT which isn't officially released yet 
(369.10 or greater), this has bug fixes in which fluxus needs to run correctly. 
Look on the fluxus website for a source download. If you have an older version 
of PLT installed already, you'll need to delete the /usr/local/lib/plt directory 
to uninstall it first. 

./configure --enable-shared --prefix=/usr/local
make
sudo make install

Fluxus install instructions
---------------------------

To build and install, type:

scons 
sudo scons install

Build options:

X11=1          : Build with the X11 libraries - rather than Xorg which is 
                 default.
				 
MULTITEXTURE=1 : Multitexturing is bad tempered on some drivers - set this to 
				 enable the multitexturing code.
				 
GLSL=0         : Set this to disable GLSL hardware shaders.

There are more settings at the top of the SConstruct file which may need to be
tweaked to correctly find things.

Building the documentation
--------------------------

The fluxus distribution contains extensive html documentation, along with online
help which can be accessed by running (help "functionname") in the fluxus console.

To build the html documentation:

cd docs/
./makedocs.sh

This will make a fluxus directory containing the html docs.
