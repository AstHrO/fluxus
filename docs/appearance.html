<h1>8.0  The appearance of primitives</h1>
Now that we have primitives and lights for shading them, it's time to introduce 
the ways that you can modify the appearence of your primitives.

<big>8.1  Surface parameters</big>

These surface parameters can be treated exactly like the rest of the state 
items - transforms, (colour) etc. They can either be set using the state stack 
when building primitives, or set later using (grab)

<c>(opacity n)</c>
set the opacity value on the current state 

<c>(specular v) </c>                       
set the specular colour on the current state 

<c>(ambient v)</c>                         
set the ambient colour on the current state

<c>(emissive v)</c>                        
set the emissive colour on the current state

<c>(shinyness n)</c>                       
set the shinyness on the current state

<c>(texture n)</c>                         
set the texture on the current state, using a texture ID

Textures are loaded using (load-texture filename), they are cached so they 
won't load more than once, so you can easily just call:

<c>(texture (load-texture "path/to/mytexture.png"))</c>

Textures have to be png format, and support alpha transparency.

<c>(line-width n)</c>

alters the line width in pixels

<c>(point-width n)</c>

alters the point width in pixels

<c>(blend-mode src dest)</c>

sets the blend mode for the primitive's alpha blending function, src and dest 
are strings of the following type:

zero
one
dst-color  
one-minus-dst-color
src-alpha		   
one-minus-src-alpha
dst-alpha
one-minus-dst-alpha
src-alpha-saturate (src only)

<big>8.2  Render hints</big>

There are other miscellaneous options that can change the way a primitive is 
rendered. These options are called hints, as for some primitives they may not 
apply, or may do different things. They are mainly useful for debugging, or 
special cases - sometimes just for some fun.

4 pixels

<c>(hint-none)</c>                         
clear the current render hints

<c>(hint-solid)</c>
render solid - defaults to on

<c>(hint-wire)</c>
render wireframe representation

<c>(hint-normal)</c>
render normals, very handy

<c>(hint-points)</c>
render vertex or cv points

<c>(hint-anti-alias)</c>
render antialiased mode

<c>(hint-unlit)</c>
disable lighting
