<h1>13.0  Physics</h1> 
The physics system, based on the ode library, allows you to program physical 
properties into objects and set them in motion. It's vital to read the ode 
documentation, which you've downloaded if you're running fluxus. There are 
full explanations of the joint types and parameters with handy diagrams - I'm 
not going to attempt to duplicate that here.

<c>(collisions 0/1)</c>
enables or disables collision detection. this is the cause of great slowness 
when doing physical particle systems, and also the cause of instability in the 
low level physics library. defaults to off.

<c>(gravity gravvec)</c>
sets the strength and direction of gravity.

<c>(surface-params slip1 slip2 softerp softcfm)</c>
sets some global surface attributes that affect friction and bouncyness 

<c>(active-box object)
(active-sphere object)
(active-cylinder object)</c>
give the object to the physics system calculating and using a 
box/sphere/cylinder as the bounding volume. as an active object, it will now 
be transformed by ode.

<c>(passive-box object)
(passive-sphere object)
(passive-cylinder object)</c>
give the object to the physics system calculating and using a 
box/sphere/cylinder as the bounding volume. as a passive object, active 
objects will collide with it.

<c>(set-mass object mass)</c>
sets the mass of an active object

<c>(ground-plane planevec planeoffset)</c>
create an infinite passive plane for use as the ground

<c>(build-hingejoint object1 object2 anchorvec hingevec)
(build-hinge2joint object1 object2 anchorvec hinge1vec hinge2vec)
(build-sliderjoint hingevec)
(build-balljoint object1 object2 anchorvec)
(build-amotorjoint axisvec)</c>
builds joints between two objects

<c>(joint-param joint param value)</c>
where param is one of the following:
"HiStop", 
"Vel", 
"FMax", 
"FudgeFactor", 
"Bounce", 
"CFM", 
"StopERP", 
"StopCFM", 
"SuspensionERP", 
"SuspensionCFM", 
"Vel2", 
"FMax2"
sets the joint paramater for joint 
	
<c>(kick object kickvec)</c>
applies translation force kickvec to the object

<c>(twist object twistvec)</c>
applies rotational force twistvec to the object
	
<c>(set-max-physical num)</c>
sets the maximum number of objects the physics system can deal with. when the 
max level has been reached the oldest objects are destroyed.

<c>(has-collided id)</c>
returns true if the grabbed object collided in the last frame
