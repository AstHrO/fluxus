<h1>13.0  Physics</h1>

The physics system, based on the ode library, allows you to add physical
properties to objects and set them in motion. Since ODE is designed for
rigid-body simulations, structures are described in terms of objects, joints and
forces. 

 - simple interactions
 - joints are treated like objects, {ie. set! etc+}
 - forces for joints
 - environmental forces
 - twists & kicks
 - hints for reducing computation {eg. max-physical, collisions, ..}

A much more comprehensive explanation of these concepts can be found in the ODE
documentation, which you have probably downloaded if you have compiled fluxus,
or can be found at <a href="http://ode.org/ode-docs.html">http://ode.org/ode-docs.html</a> 

<c>(collisions 0|1)</c>

enables or disables collision detection. this is the cause of great slowness 
when doing physical particle systems, and also the cause of instability in the 
low level physics library. defaults to off.

<c>(gravity gravvec)</c>

sets the strength and direction of gravity.

<c>(surface-params slip1 slip2 softerp softcfm)</c>

sets some global surface attributes that affect friction and bouncyness 

- see ode-v0.5.pdf sectiosn 3.7,3.8 and 7.3.7
- slip1&2 > mu & mu2 ?
- softerp > how 'soft' the surface appears [0..1]
- softcfm > sloppy [0..1]

<c>(active-box object)</c>
<c>(active-sphere object)</c>
<c>(active-cylinder object)</c> 

enable the object to be acted upon by the physics system, using a box, sphere or
cylinder as the bounding volume. as an active object, it will be transformed by
ode.

<c>(passive-box object)</c>
<c>(passive-sphere object)</c>
<c>(passive-cylinder object)</c>

enable the object to be acted upon by the physics system, using a box, sphere or
cylinder as the bounding volume. as a passive object, active objects will
collide with it, but it will not be transformed.

<c>(set-mass object mass)</c>
sets the mass of an active object

<c>(ground-plane planevec planeoffset)</c>
create an infinite passive plane for use as the 'ground'

<c>(build-hingejoint object1 object2 anchorvec hingevec)</c>
<c>(build-hinge2joint object1 object2 anchorvec hinge1vec hinge2vec)</c>
<c>(build-sliderjoint hingevec)</c>
<c>(build-balljoint object1 object2 anchorvec)</c>
<c>(build-amotorjoint axisvec)</c>

create joints to connect two objects (see the ode docs for a detailed
description of the differences between the joint types). ode considers joints to
be a constraint that is enforced between two objects. when creating a joint, it
is important to have the two primitives being joined in the desired positions
before creating the joint.

"In real life a joint is something like a hinge, that is used to connect two
objects. In ODE a joint is very similar: It is a relationship that is enforced
between two bodies so that they can only have certain positions and orientations
relative to each other. This relationship is called a constraint - the words
joint and constraint are often used interchangeably." -- ode.docs


<c>(joint-param joint param value)</c>
where param is one of the following:
"HiStop", 
"Vel", 
"FMax", 
"FudgeFactor", 
"Bounce", 
"CFM", 
"StopERP", 
"StopCFM", 
"SuspensionERP", 
"SuspensionCFM", 
"Vel2", 
"FMax2"
sets the joint paramater for joint 
	
<c>(joint-angle joint velocity angle)</c>

set the angle of the joint, with a given velocity {?}

<c>(kick object kickvec)</c>

applies translation force kickvec to the object

<c>(twist object twistvec)</c>

applies rotational force twistvec to the object
	
<c>(set-max-physical num)</c>

sets the maximum number of objects the physics system can deal with. when the 
max level has been reached the oldest objects are destroyed.

<c>(has-collided id)</c>                      

returns true if the grabbed object collided in the last frame
