This is an experimental binding of fluxus to python. 
Intended as a simple sketchbook tool for games design rather than livecoded 
visuals, as personally I think python is more suited to that than scheme is.

I might flesh this out a little more in the future, but its highly labcoat stuff
for now... feel free to expand.

pyflux implements these commands so far:

show_axis
push  	   
pop		   
identity     
apply		
clear   
grab    
ungrab  
translate
rotate  
scale   
parent  
clear_colour
colour  
opacity 
load_texture
texture		  
build_cube	   
build_plane	   
build_cylinder  
build_line	   
build_sphere    
ortho 		  
persp 		  
backfacecull    
desiredfps	  
print_scene_graph
engine_callback 
key_pressed
