Fluxus : (C) 2005 Dave Griffiths : dave at pawfal dot org : www.pawfal.org

fluxus is a dependancy heavy application

requires:
ode        http://opende.sourceforge.net/
guile      http://www.gnu.org/software/guile/guile.html
fftw       http://www.fftw.org/
jack       http://jackit.sourceforge.net/
libsndfile http://www.mega-nerd.com/libsndfile/
liblo      http://plugin.org.uk/liblo/

and if that's not enough, you'll also need scons (http://www.scons.org/) to build fluxus

to build and install, type:

sudo scons install

Build options:

X11=1          : Build with the X11 libraries - rather than Xorg which is 
                 default.

MULTITEXTURE=0 : Multitexturing is checked at configure time, but it can cause
                 crashes on some drivers - set this to disable the 
				 multitexturing code manually.

building the documentation:

cd docs/
./builddocs.sh

this will make a fluxus directory containing the html docs
