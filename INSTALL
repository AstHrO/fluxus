Fluxus : (C) 2007 Dave Griffiths : dave at pawfal dot org : www.pawfal.org

Fluxus is a dependancy heavy application

Requires:
ode        http://opende.sourceforge.net/
plt scheme http://www.plt-scheme.org/
fftw       http://www.fftw.org/
jack       http://jackit.sourceforge.net/
libsndfile http://www.mega-nerd.com/libsndfile/
liblo      http://plugin.org.uk/liblo/

And if that's not enough, you'll also need scons (http://www.scons.org/) to 
build fluxus

To build and install, type:

sudo scons install

Build options:

X11=1          : Build with the X11 libraries - rather than Xorg which is 
                 default.
				 
MULTITEXTURE=1 : Multitexturing is bad tempered on some drivers - set this to 
				 enable the multitexturing code.
				 
GLSL=0         : Set this to disable GLSL hardware shaders.

Building the documentation:

cd docs/
sudo ./makedocs.sh

This will make a fluxus directory containing the html docs, and install the 
fluxus helpmap so you can use the "help" command from within fluxus.
