Fluxus : (C) 2007 Dave Griffiths : dave at pawfal dot org : www.pawfal.org
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Fluxus is a dependancy heavy application

Requires:
ode        http://opende.sourceforge.net/
plt scheme http://www.plt-scheme.org/ (see below)
fftw       http://www.fftw.org/
jack       http://jackit.sourceforge.net/
libsndfile http://www.mega-nerd.com/libsndfile/
liblo      http://plugin.org.uk/liblo/

And if that's not enough, you'll also need scons (http://www.scons.org/) to 
build fluxus

PLT install instructions
------------------------

For the moment you need a version of PLT which isn't officially released yet 
(369.10 or greater), this has bug fixes in which fluxus needs to run correctly. 
Look on the fluxus website for a source download. If you have an older version 
of PLT installed already, you'll need to delete the /usr/local/lib/plt directory 
to uninstall it first. 

./configure --enable-shared --prefix=/usr/local
make
sudo make install

Fluxus install instructions
---------------------------

To build and install, type:

scons 
sudo scons install

Build options:

X11=1          : Build with the X11 libraries - rather than Xorg which is 
                 default.
				 
MULTITEXTURE=1 : Multitexturing is bad tempered on some drivers - set this to 
				 enable the multitexturing code.
				 
GLSL=0         : Set this to disable GLSL hardware shaders.

Building the documentation:

cd docs/
sudo ./makedocs.sh

This will make a fluxus directory containing the html docs.
